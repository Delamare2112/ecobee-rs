# Ecobee for Rust!  
This could be used as a starting point for a more complete crate.  Maybe one day I will take the time and finish it!  

## What you get with this
The crate has everything one would need to check the status of most ecobee products and update the thermostat settings.  For example,
I use this to monitor if a door or window has been opened and enable or disable the thermostat accordingly.  Take a look at the [auto_door.rs](https://gitlab.com/Delamare/ecobee/-/blob/master/examples/auto_door.rs) example to see how I do that!

This wrapper around the API is very light and still requires that the user have a decent understanding of the Ecobee API.
